  <h1>Web & HTML Basics</h1>

<b>Introduction to the Web</b>

<p>
The world wide web is a collection of <em>Hyper Text Markup 
Language</em> (HTML) documents that are connected by
hyperlinks. Various files can be found on the web,
from plain text and HTML documents to images, videos, 
music, and much more.
</p>

<p>
Using web broswers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Mozilla), users can make
requests on the internet for any one of these various files.
The internet sends the request, using an 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">
http protocol</a>, to a server. The server, which houses the files, 
responds to the request with files.
</p>

<b>Introduction to HTML</b>

<p>
HTML is made up of...</br>
• Text (<em>what you see</em>)</br>
• Markup (<em>what it looks like</em>)</br>
• References to other documents (<em>e.g., images or videos</em>)</br>
• Links to other pages (<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">like this</a></a></em>)
